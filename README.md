Level 7

**Requirements**

*Fork this repository and clone it down to your local machine*

Design a multi-page website with the following page designations:

**Students will use HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a fully functioning and attractive website with the following pages:**

Home page
About
Contact info
Products page
Shopping cart
Checkout
Frequently Asked Questions
Personal Profile

**Build a simple one page product list that has no fewer than 9 (a 3 by 3 image table), products and prices.**

Students will use PHP to retrieve a list of products from a MySQL products table.
Students will use PHP to iterate over the returned list and display product details using code islands in PHP/HTML

**Each product will have a qty (quantity) and price field, as well as an "Add to Cart" button.**

Students will use PHP’s formatting functions to properly format name, currency, and description text of the products.

**When the "Add to Cart" button is pressed, the product should be added to an object or multidimensional array that contains the product, qty, and price.**

Students will use either MySQL or browser session storage/cookies to track and manage the shopping cart.

**On the same page, below the products, the students will place the cart table that displays the list of products, qtys, and prices as well as the running total, tax, and total price (price + tax).**

Students will use JavaScript’s math operators to correctly calculate values. This will include proper rounding and formatting for display.

**Above and beyond**

Students can build a basic login mechanism using PHP/MySQL so that a user can login to save their cart to a table in the MySQL database.

Students can build a fake checkout system where fake payment information is collected and stored in the database along with all necessary data (shipping address, order info, etc.)
